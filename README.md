# mtgscan

A cross-platform phone app for rapidly scanning Magic: The Gathering cards, keeping a collection, and building Commander decks. An authenticated remote MCP service lets compatible AI chats search the card catalog and collection, inspect decks, and make deck suggestions.

Product and architecture decisions are being resolved in the project Wayfinder map.

## Development

The repo is a Bun workspace. The Expo app lives in `apps/mobile`. The public website, with the homepage and privacy policy, is static HTML in `apps/site`.

1. Install dependencies with `bun install`.
2. Build and open the development build in the iOS simulator with `bun run --filter @mtgscan/mobile ios`.

Public build-time settings go in `apps/mobile/.env`. `apps/mobile/.env.example` lists their names. Never put a service role key in the app.

Checks run on every pull request. Run them locally with `bun run typecheck`, `bun run lint`, and `bun run test`.

### Local Supabase

The Supabase project lives in `supabase`: configuration, SQL migrations, generated types, and database tests. The local stack needs Docker and the Supabase CLI 2.120.0.

1. Copy `supabase/.env.example` to `supabase/.env` and fill in the Google client IDs, web ID first, then iOS ID, separated by a comma. Native Google sign-in does not use the secret. The Apple provider needs no setting. Its client ID is the bundle ID, `dev.reilley.mtgscan`. Native Sign in with Apple does not use a secret.
2. Start the stack from the repo root with `supabase start`.
3. Run the database tests with `bun run test:database`.
4. After you change a migration, run `supabase db reset` and then `bun run types:database`. CI fails when `supabase/database.types.ts` does not match the migrations.

To run the app against the local stack, put the local API URL and publishable key from `supabase status` in `apps/mobile/.env.local`. It overrides `apps/mobile/.env`.

To use Sign in with Apple in the iOS simulator, sign in with an Apple ID in the simulator's Settings app first. The build signs with the team in `ios.appleTeamId`, because the Sign in with Apple capability needs a signed app.

### Development build on an iPhone

EAS Build makes the development build for a physical iPhone and shares it through internal distribution. Only iPhones registered with the Apple Developer account can install it.

`apps/mobile/eas.json` has three build profiles. Each profile uses the EAS environment with the same name. That environment holds the Supabase URL, the publishable key, and the Google client IDs.

| Profile | EAS environment | Build |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `development` | development | Development build with the developer tools, for registered iPhones |
| `preview` | preview | The app with its JavaScript bundled, for registered iPhones |
| `production` | production | The app for the App Store |

Run the commands from `apps/mobile`. They need the EAS CLI 24.4.2 or later (`npm install -g eas-cli`) and a login to the `reilley` Expo account (`eas login`). Older versions fail to log in to Apple with "iTunes service key is empty".

1. Register the iPhone with `eas device:create`. Sign in to the Apple Developer account, choose the website option, and open the URL or QR code on the iPhone. Install the profile that it downloads in the Settings app.
2. Build with `eas build --profile development --platform ios`. The first build asks for the Apple Developer login. Let EAS create and manage the distribution certificate and the provisioning profile. Later builds reuse them. After you register another iPhone, build again and let EAS add the iPhone to the provisioning profile.
3. Open the build link or scan the QR code from the build output with the iPhone, and tap **Install**. If iOS asks for Developer Mode, turn it on in Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Mode, and restart the iPhone.
4. Start Metro with `bunx expo start --dev-client`. The Mac and the iPhone must be on the same network. Open mtgscan on the iPhone and choose the server, or scan the QR code in the terminal with the Camera app.

A preview or production build bundles its JavaScript with the values from its EAS environment. A development build gets its JavaScript from Metro, which reads `apps/mobile/.env`. Only the Google iOS URL scheme in the development build comes from the EAS development environment. Keep `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` the same in both places, or Google sign-in fails. Delete `apps/mobile/.env.local` to use the hosted Supabase project.

### Versions

The app version in `apps/mobile/app.json` follows the release version. Release-please updates it together with the root `package.json`. EAS keeps the iOS build number (`cli.appVersionSource` is `remote`) and increments it for each production build.

### Catalog search

Signed-in users search the card catalog with `supabase.rpc('search_catalog', { query })`. The query is a typed object, never a query string. `supabase/search.ts` has the shared types for the query, the result page, and errors.

- A refused call returns an error with a `code` such as `invalid_argument` or `invalid_cursor`. The field at fault is in `details`. `readSearchError` reads it as a `SearchError`.
- Each first page writes one row to `search_telemetry`. It is the one table with user data that has no read policy: app users cannot read it, and only the secret key can.

### Card catalog imports

`bun run import <command>` in `supabase` runs an import with `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`. Pass `--manifest <path>` to read a fixture instead of the Scryfall bulk data manifest.

- `catalog` imports cards and card printings. The Weekly import workflow runs it.
- `prices` imports current prices from Scryfall Default Cards and recomputes each card's lowest current price.
- `prune-telemetry` deletes search telemetry older than 180 days.
- `retry-weekly` runs again each weekly source whose latest run failed.

The Daily import workflow runs `prices`, `prune-telemetry`, and `retry-weekly`. Each run records an import run, so the hosted project does not pause. The Import workflow runs one source by hand.

### Per-user data

Every table that holds a user's data follows one pattern:

- Row-level security is on, and the read policy returns only the signed-in user's rows.
- Direct inserts, updates, and deletes are revoked for the `anon` and `authenticated` roles.
- Changes go only through database functions. Each function runs in one transaction and checks the caller's identity.

Signing up creates the user's profile through a trigger on `auth.users`.
